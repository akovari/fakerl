*Fakerl* is an Erlang application that generates fake data for you.
Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

Fakerl is a port of Python's [Faker][python-faker], and was motivated
by a need for a bunch of fake data for writing test suites.
